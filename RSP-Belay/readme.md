## Documentation:
    Rock, paper, scissors is a hand game played by two or more players where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The three shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V). The game has only three possible outcomes other than a tie: a player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors but will lose to one who has played paper; a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors but will beat a play of rock; and a play of scissors will lose to paper but will beat rock.

## Rules:
    Rock beats scissors.
    Scissors beats paper.
    Paper beats rock.
    If both players choose the same option, it's a tie.
    
## Procedures:
    The game begins with both players choosing one of the three hand gestures, rock, paper or scissors, at the same time.
    After the choices are made, they are compared to see who wins based on the rules.
    If both players have made the same choice, the game is tied.
    The game continues with players making choices and comparing them until a winner is declared.
